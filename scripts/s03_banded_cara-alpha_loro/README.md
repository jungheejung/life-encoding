## Banded Ridge

You will submit the jobs by typing `mksub BANDEDRIDGE01_submit.sh` on your HPC. 
Jobs are submitted as job arrays, pulled from the canonical_sublist.txt
In other words, each hemisphere, participant, feature is submitted as a separate job

We carefully followed the banded ridge regression tutorial from the Gallant lab ([link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gallantlab/tikreg/blob/master/examples/tutorial_banded_ridge_polar.ipynb)).

In this code, we use "background", "agents", and "actions" as our feature. 
In our code, we use all of the alphas and ratios (whereas the notebook tutorial walksthrough one or a number of alphas)
